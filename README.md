# Recreational Human Disturbance Data in BC

## Project Overview
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the research, documentation, and automation of data collection related to **recreational human disturbance** in British Columbia. As part of the broader effort led by GeoBC and the Cumulative Effects Framework (CEF), this project focuses specifically on identifying and incorporating recreational infrastructure such as ski areas, golf courses, and other outdoor facilities into the Human Disturbance dataset.

## Contacts
- **Ingrid Espinosa Malpica**: Team Lead (Product Owner)
- **Eric Millan**: Geospatial Coordinator (Technical Lead)
- **Candice Steinke**: Geomatics with Mountain Resorts Branch (Subject Matter Expert)

## Objectives
1. **Identify and assess datasets** related to recreational land use in BC.
2. **Engage with data custodians** to ensure the best available datasets are included.
3. **Develop and automate data processing workflows** using Python and geospatial tools.
4. **Integrate validated recreational disturbance data** into the larger Human Disturbance dataset.
5. **Document research findings and methodologies** for transparency and reproducibility.

## Project Scope
This repository will include:
- **Research documentation** on available datasets and validation processes.
- **Python scripts** for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Test data** where applicable to support methodology development.
- **Decision logs** outlining the reasoning behind dataset selection and exclusion.

## Workflow
### **Phase 1: Data Scoping & Research (January – April 2025)**
- Identify existing datasets for ski areas, golf courses, and other recreational sites.
- Engage with dataset custodians to assess data quality and availability.
- Document decision-making criteria for dataset inclusion.
- Conduct a gap analysis to determine missing or underrepresented data.

### **Phase 2: Data Processing & Automation (April – May 2025)**
- Develop Python scripts to standardize and preprocess recreational disturbance data.
- Automate spatial data integration workflows using GIS tools.
- Incorporate new datasets and refine data ranking methodologies.

### **Phase 3: Quality Control & Validation (May – September 2025)**
- Conduct internal reviews and collaborate with subject-matter experts.
- Test the impact of recreational disturbance data within the larger Human Disturbance dataset.
- Iterate on methodologies based on feedback and findings.

### **Phase 4: Finalization & Integration (July – December 2025)**
- Finalize dataset documentation and metadata.
- Ensure alignment with the overall Human Disturbance dataset requirements.
- Support the integration of recreational disturbance data into the final published dataset.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (for data processing, automation, and analysis)
- **ArcGIS Pro / QGIS** (for spatial data processing)
- **Remote sensing & LiDAR** (for enhanced dataset validation, if applicable)
- **GeoBC & Open Data sources** (for accessing relevant spatial datasets)

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome, particularly in the areas of:
- Identifying and validating new recreational disturbance datasets.
- Improving Python scripts for data automation.
- Providing insights into data quality and classification.

If you'd like to contribute, please refer to the repository's contribution guidelines.
